# Vega test

– VEGA testing is a method of measuring a change in an acupuncture point. By placing a test substance into the measuring
circuit the practitioner can readily observe these changes.

Testing various ampoules provides the practitioner with an energetic evaluation of the health of the specific organs, tissues, and body systems, as well as indicating the affectivity of a particular remedy.

Localisation of the source of an abnormal response is accomplished by placing homeopathic extracts in this electrical loop.

Utilising the body’s natural energy conduits, through Bio-Feedback, a computerised instrument assists in the assessment and treatment of patient illness.
